# VIGENERE CIPHER PROJECT

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encryption that uses a series of different Caesar ciphers based on the letters of a keyword. It was invented by Giovan Battista Bellaso in the 16th century and later improved by Blaise de Vigenère in the 19th century.

To encrypt a message with the Vigenère cipher, the message is first divided into blocks of a certain length. Then, each letter of the message is replaced with a letter that is a certain number of letters away in the alphabet, based on the letter of the keyword that corresponds to that position in the message. For example, if the message is "ATTACKATDAWN" and the key is "LEMON", the first letter, 'A', would be replaced with an 'L' (12 letters away), the second letter, 'T', would be replaced with an 'E' (5 letters away), and so on.

To decrypt a message that has been encrypted with the Vigenère cipher, the reverse process is used. The letters of the keyword are used to generate a series of Caesar ciphers, which are then used to decrypt the message.

There are a few variations of the Vigenère cipher, but the basic idea is always the same. It is a simple yet effective way to encrypt a message and can be very difficult to break if the key is long enough and kept secret.
